# Echo-State-Networks
Implementation of Echo State Networks. In this repository I try to recreate the Echo State Network form the code
form https://mantas.info/code/simple_esn/ by the author Dr. Mantas Lukoševičius and modify it to make it more modular
and easy to generalize. The ideas are taken form the paper by the same author:

A practical guide to applying Echo State Networks
